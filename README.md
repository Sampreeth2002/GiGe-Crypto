#Gige
GiGe is a platform for sharing goods and services among students using a cryptocurrency like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Students can upload "gives" and see various "gets". In "get", you spend crypto by getting some items, and in "give", you earn points by giving your items to students. That item can be almost anything like books, video games, assignments, electronics, projects, cycles, sports goods, etc. The giver has to upload details about the service or product. It is basically an ecosystem that thrives on people helping each other. Students who "give" earn crypto and can spend that crypto in the app to "get" things they need. Also when you buy a "get" you pay crypto after you pick up the item from the giver. The pickup address is mentioned in the give and you can chat and get to know specifics and set the time and other things. We have set up systems like Smart contracts to ensure safe and secure transactions of crypto, goods, and services in the student community. We plan to scale it to increase the customer base from colleges to whole cities in the future.
